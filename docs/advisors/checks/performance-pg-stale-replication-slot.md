# PostgreSQL stale replication slot

## Description

Stale replication slots lead to WAL file accumulation. This can result in a database server outage.

A stale replication slot is a slot that satisfies the following criteria:

- Not a temporary slot.
- Not an active slot.
- WAL distance between current WAL position and slotâ€™s restart log sequence number is more than the current setting for the `max_wal_size` configuration option.

## Resolution

Review the output of the `SELECT * FROM pg_replication_slots` query and identify the slots that are inactive and have an old `restart_lsn`. 

Drop such slots as soon as possible. You can recreate the slot, but note that the receiving end might need to be re-synchronized.
